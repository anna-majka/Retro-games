# Snake

A vanilla JavaScript grid-based game. Inspired by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://github.com/kubowania/Nokia3310-Snake) [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rui2tRRVtc0).

## Styling
The styling is my idea, inspired by retro video games.

## What I learned
* event listeners
* query Selectors
* arrow functions
* forEach
* setting time intervals and countdowns
