The "Space Invaders" is a HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript grid-based game. 
Inspired by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://github.com/kubowania/space-invaders) & freeCodeCamp [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk&t=1s).

Space Invaders is a game in which you as the shooter have to shoot down as many alien invaders before they get to you. 

## Styling
The styling is my idea, inspired by retro video games.

## What I learned
* for loops
* addEventListener
