# Connect Four

The "Connect four" is a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript grid-based game. Inspired by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://github.com/kubowania/connect-four) & freeCodeCamp [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk&t=1s).

Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)) is a two-player board game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

## Rules :
* You will start as player One
* You will take your go as player One
* You will not be allowed to go in squares that are not at the bottom of the grid, or do not have a taken square under it
* Once your go is taken and you did not win, It will be player Two's go
* The gamer will continue until a winning combination of four is reached by player One or player Two, or until the grid is full and no winning combination was found.

## Styling :
The styling is my idea, inspired by retro video games.

## What I learned :
* for loops
* addEventListener
* document.querySelector
* arrow functions
