The "Whac-a-mole", a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript grid-based game.
Inspired by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://github.com/kubowania/whac-a-mole) & freeCodeCamp [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk&t=1s).

## Rules :
The player needs to hit the grid with the mole in as many times as possible until the time runs out. 

## Styling :
The styling is my idea, inspired by retro video games.

## What I learned :
* document.querySelector
* textContent
* forEach
* addEventListener
* setInterval
* classList.add
