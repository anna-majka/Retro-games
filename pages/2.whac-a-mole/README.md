The "Whac-a-mole", a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript grid-based game inspired by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://github.com/kubowania/whac-a-mole) & freeCodeCamp [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk&t=1s).

The player needs to hit the grid with the mole in as many times as possible until the time runs out. 

The styling is my idea, inspired by retro video games.

What I learned :
* document.querySelector
* textContent
* forEach
* addEventListener
* setInterval
* classList.add
