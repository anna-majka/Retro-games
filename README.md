# Retro-games
Learning JavaScript by building retro grid-based games.

All the games are inspired by [Ania Kub√≥w](https://www.youtube.com/aniakubow) and freeCodecamp [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk&t=1s).

Each game has its own README.md file with all the details. 

The styling is my idea and was inspired by retro video games.
